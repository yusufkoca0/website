Wandered into the forest older than my name <br>
Where roots curled like arterial veins <br>
Pumping life into a vessel of something divine. <br>
Even the wind hesitantly blows <br>
As if it may awaken something malign.

The first trees I met greeted me with a gentle bow. <br>
Barks covered in countless prayers of my kind. <br>
Leaves hushed in harmony of a delicate mother. <br>
Subtle and gentle voices lingered in my mind. <br>
It was its way to confess, to mutter.

The light perforating the small gaps in air <br>
Fell to the ground like an arrow of an archer. <br>
No shadow dared to challenge their wrath <br>
And no stray soul would perjure <br>
On this sanctified path.

I wandered far, far into the depths of its lure <br>
Where moss covers each of its prayers. <br>
I heard the whispers of its will <br>
Hushing me to not leave in tears. <br>
Soft embraces left me in a chill.

Then right there I felt the gaze of a creature. <br>
A set of eyes of a deer looking at me cowardly <br>
With a sharp hesitation its tongue twisted <br>
And it squeaked to me tenderly <br>
Told me a place I would feel belonged.

I wandered to the very core of the forest. <br>
There laid a throne with a kid on top.

Crownless, he was embracing himself. <br>
Shivering, he was comforting himself. <br>
Alone, he was befriending himself.

Strange feeling filled inside my stomach <br>
And I threw up every bit of my guts. <br>
I knew that child who was bereft of comfort.

Once I arrived near him, <br>
He opened his eyes in quite wonder. <br>
Merely whispered my name <br>
Told me he knew I would wander <br>
and he knew I would come.

That night I stood by <br>
And eased him as he confessed <br>
His final breath.

Next morning I sat on the throne <br>
And strangely I was crowned <br>
With a set of thorns.

It became the beginning of my waiting <br>
For someone who would dethrone <br>
This self I call mine.
