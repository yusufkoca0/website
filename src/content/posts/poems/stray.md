I miss a place that I have never been to, <br>
Somewhere so mystical only exists in mind. <br>
To find it you must go through and through <br>
The wrinkles of the brain inside my head.

Used to play there when I was a little kid, <br>
And it used to be the grave I was meant to be buried.

Unilluminated by any external sources. <br>
Yet it had this soft glow that embraced the eyes. <br>
You could truly see in the morning <br>
But would dream some parts in the evening. <br>
Truly a magnificent ontology <br>
Surrounded by one's imagery.

There was not a single clock. <br>
You could hear no tick-tock. <br>
Incenses were burnt to tell time. <br>
One I remember smelled just like a lime. <br>
It makes the memory vivid <br>
When the time is this lucid.

Believe me, it is a magical place. <br>
Nobody knows where it lies. <br>
I spent my youth to find its secrets. <br>
All left in my hand was <br>
These meaningless barrens.

Nostalgia truly bends the reality. <br>
Can you call it that way <br>
If it is only imaginary? <br>
I am so stray, so stray...
