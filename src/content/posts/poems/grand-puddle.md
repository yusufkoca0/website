Was lost at a hopeless ocean. <br>
A place of no escape, without divine intervention. <br>
Was paddling across like a devotion, <br>
Without ever stopping the motion.

No God answered my prayers. <br>
I passed by the Old ones, <br>
Were floating atop, their carcasses. <br>
New ones were too prideful for human matters.

At an unknown night I met. <br>
With full of stars, sky was set. <br>
The Moon was cut in half, by fate. <br>
Calender has shown me no certain date.

A piece of art on a grand puddle. <br>
Spoke to me like a loving mother, <br>
One word at a time, without a hustle. <br>
Helped me throw away all my trouble.

After that event I became wiser, <br>
With a knowledge so grandeur. <br>
Shined to me the North star, <br>
In order to help me dock myself at a shore.

It was peaceful and gentle. <br>
With no one there, I was single. <br>
A new liver, won't be consumed by an eagle. <br>
Finally took a nap, deep and ethereal.
