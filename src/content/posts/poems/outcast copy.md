Forgive me Father for I have sinned. <br>
Not against the Divine. <br>
Not against vows. <br>
But against the ordinary.

I have sinned, <br>
Because my lungs still agree with me, <br>
Because my tongue still twists, <br>
Because my cords still carry sound, <br>
Because my heart did not ask him before it kept going.

I confess, <br>
I assumed he would remain, <br>
I assumed he would wake up <br>
As the Sun does, <br>
Without interruption, <br>
Without negotiation. <br>
I have mistaken continuity <br>
For certainty.

Forgive me Father, <br>
Forgive me... <br>
I still find him in every silence, <br>
I still hear his name in every incomplete sentence.

I confess, <br>
The doors are still opening, <br>
Sidewalks are still walked on, <br>
Sun still rises and sets <br>
Time still moves on <br>
As I do.

Forgive me, <br>
For I was too busy becoming tomorrow <br>
While he was already turning into memory.

I have sinned, <br>
Not because of his death <br>
But because of my survival.

I ask for absolution, <br>
Because I lived <br>
And he died.

Forgive me, <br>
For taking it for granted <br>
Then mourning it like a little child.

Forgive me Father for I have sinned <br>
And never confessed.

Amen.
