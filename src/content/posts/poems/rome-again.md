Here I am, again. <br>
Every road leads to Rome they say, <br>
It seems every pleasure leads to the same pain. <br>
I find not a single place to escape away.

I feel the melancholy <br>
Of unworshipped and forgotten deities, <br>
Of leaves that are turning bloody red, <br>
Of parents who cradle borrowed lives, <br>
Of questions no one dared to ask and left unanswered.

I feel the futility <br>
Of confessed and embraced sins, <br>
Of infertile hard boiled eggs, <br>
Of visually identical twins, <br>
Of immobile paralyzed legs.

I feel the laments <br>
Of the first snowlakes in winter that melts, <br>
Of the whales rotting at the bottom of the ocean, <br>
Of the sun that repeatedly rises and sets, <br>
Of a nonbeliever's unending devotion.

I feel the resentment <br>
Of unremembered souls under the mother Earth, <br>
Of the bride that was meant to die a virgin, <br>
Of unmined diamonds with no worth, <br>
Of the seed under solid concrete that was meant to burgeon.

I feel all this life and death, <br>
But for what and why? <br>
Is this what it means to be alive?

How does one kill their ego?

Unwind me, oh God <br>
If you hear me. <br>
But I doubt that you ever do. <br>
I see no tears of yours <br>
That drop from the heavens.
