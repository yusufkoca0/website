Under a monument of eternity and mortality, <br>
Exists not a single prominent morality. <br>
There lies a profaned God, creation of Man. <br>
Deity of lies and fraud, ideals overran.

What an arrogance! It offers the flame of Its soul <br>
To those drowned in ignorance,  who would call It foul. <br>
Devoured by pride, the primordial sin, <br>
With a few to abide and call It their own kin.

See, how It clings to the remnants of praise, <br>
A hollow echo of Its long-gone bright days. <br>
Tell me, can you still call it devotion, <br>
If the source springs solely from admiration?

Its voice once trembled down the Heavens <br>
Now diluted, dwindling to withered sighs... <br>
And the Man, who birthed this omniscient wraith <br>
Disowns the deceased body of his own faith.

Can it still be divine and sacred <br>
If the bloodline is no longer worshipped? <br>
You know they would point out the ashes <br>
And call Its rebirth a deceit, a disgrace.

Judge not the Divine for falling out of grace, <br>
Nothing but a mirror to our own place. <br>
We worship a mere replica of ourselves. <br>
Its birth, fall and death, a sewn lesson that dwells.
