Fragments of a child, in a little hive buzzing. <br>
With a thin thread tangled in a mood of fussing. <br>
Ah, my beloved, what a messy state of being, <br>
They call you a tiny kid, yet you feel so big.

Once you become a youngling, with lost connections, <br>
Then, you will remember this moment with confessions. <br>
Ripening fruit of yours, be careful not to let it go rotten, <br>
For all the things so mature, bound to be forgotten.

When you're grown up with a dead God at your feet, <br>
Lift yourself up and find a new path to make ends meet. <br>
Buzzing bees will stop at a certain moment. <br>
You must adapt and ensure they never go silent.

For what lies ahead-unpredictable erosions, <br>
I am out of advice, even for me, unreached it remains. <br>
I know the inconsistent future deeply saddens <br>
But keep your worries far until the moment arrives.

You tend to see the bad through your hazy eyes, <br>
Yet always look for the good in whatever happens. <br>
Pessimistic nature of yours, still untamed. <br>
It's our job to nurture and make it congruent.
