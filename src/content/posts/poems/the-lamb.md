In a spontaneous turn of events <br>
I find the meaning of my own birth. <br>
It is shown to me clearly: what love is. <br>
And that I am the harbinger of faith.

My hands were made to hold nails, <br>
Blood was given to me to taste intoxicating. <br>
The home built for me was the crucifix, <br>
I was made for the sole act of sacrificing.

I accept that I am God's favourite lamb. <br>
The sounds echoing through my cords, then my throat <br>
Sound so cute and perhaps a bit dumb. <br>
It is the last bit of air in a scapegoat.

Oh, but tell me, just tell me why? <br>
Why must I bear so much pain? <br>
Does it satisfy you to look at me in wry? <br>
Why must I be your sacred fane?

Perhaps it is clear that there is no answer <br>
And that there never will be one. <br>
I accept the fool I am, a mere dancer, <br>
Just to satisfy the very needs of the One.

Endless times I will give my body, my soul. <br>
Until no more there is something to call "I." <br>
Hope the eyes that are blind see your drool, <br>
And the ears that are deaf hear your lie.

Your kingdom shall one day fall, <br>
Headless sheep may run over your body. <br>
Sacrifices you find so beloved may go dull, <br>
And I, your favourite, shall stand proud as Mahdi.
