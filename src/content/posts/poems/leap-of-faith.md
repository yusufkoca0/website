I got kicked out of Heaven today,<br>
With no angels in sight to hold my hand.<br>
As I fall from the above sky,<br>
I am getting closer to the below ground.

Surface looks so soft from halfway,<br>
All desires sound so fragile.<br>
As I hit, my body tolls a belfry.<br>
My bones sing a one last rhyme.

Earth drags me down to the depths.<br>
I stand still at the gates of Hell,<br>
With no demon in sight to grace.<br>
A sense of relaxation I feel,

As I understand it clearly.<br>
There is no God or Devil to be scared,<br>
No good and no evil to see.<br>
Strange all the trouble, man created.
