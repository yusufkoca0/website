I got kicked out of Heaven today,
With no angels in sight to hold my hand.
As I fall from the above sky,
I am getting closer to the below ground.

Surface looks so soft from halfway,
All desires sound so fragile.
As I hit, my body tolls a belfry.
My bones sing a one last rhyme.

Earth drags me down to the depths.
I stand still at the gates of Hell,
With no demon in sight to grace.
A sense of relaxation I feel,

As I understand it clearly.
There is no God or Devil to be scared,
No good and no evil to see.
Strange all the trouble, man created.
