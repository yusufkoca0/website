Echoes of screams <br>
Remains unheard. <br>
In the abyssal chaos <br>
We call it the mind.

Enwrapped by the void, <br>
Flakes of thought, <br>
Falls upon the ground, <br>
Softly tears the drought.

None seen by the eye, <br>
Unnreflected all the rays. <br>
In the silent play <br>
We call it the conscience.

When the two meet <br>
Only then it appears. <br>
A place, in time, trapped. <br>
Time confined, in that place.

Touch is derogatory, <br>
Everything is fragile. <br>
In the exhibition <br>
We call it the memory.

Narrow is the passage <br>
Opens up to the museum. <br>
Without someone to manage <br>
Inside is pure freedom.

Sour meets the tongue <br>
Taste is unpleasing. <br>
In the feast lounge <br>
We call it the feeling.

Cook is a silhouette <br>
Fading away. <br>
Only to annhilate, <br>
Of the salvation way.

Smell is rotten, <br>
Cold as ice. <br>
In the field, forgotten, <br>
We call it the life.

Hangs a complex knot <br>
Like a chandelier. <br>
Is the path to out <br>
And disappear.
