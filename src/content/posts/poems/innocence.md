Poor little lamb among the wolves, innocent and pure. <br>
It is the reason of your existence, no need to be demure. <br>
You were born to be the prey, do not weep. <br>
Run to your mother and pray before your blood seep.

Vile wolves around the lamb, all guilty and conceited. <br>
Straighten your camb, for this moment you lived. <br>
You will die as a predator, do not grin. <br>
Run to your inheritor after you commit the sin.

Rueful sheep your chance to elope, do not look back. <br>
Fresh progeny will develop if your body is in tact. <br>
Mirthful cub your day to hatch, do not hesitate. <br>
Detrited lineage you shall match, unless you will desolate.
