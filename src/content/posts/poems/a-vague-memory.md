Woken up by the reminiscence of a fading moment, <br>
Vague presence of someone or something, now absent. <br>
My eyes rolled and rolled in their sockets restlessly, <br>
Paralysis doomed upon my body pretentiously.

The lid of the concrete coffin, with no stars to glitter, <br>
No conceit is felt when one can only do witter. <br>
Inevitable figure with its scythe chuckled, <br>
Spared my only wealth and left me unshackled.

Next moment, I left my bed and stood in front of the door. <br>
With all the fallacies embedded into me, I ran out like a wild boar. <br>
A pristine and pure cold swept across my face, <br>
Crystalline flakes had been wept on the entire surface.

Only the wind chimed in my ear and a melody, a song never sung before. <br>
It lingered in the air and sounded like a metaphor. <br>
I looked around and around to find the source that tingled my soul. <br>
What I could find was only a lyre abandoned on the soil.

I sat down and harsh reality hit me. I searched for something lost, <br>
Something that was ground through the flow of time and soon would become dust. <br>
Suddenly a mystical beast appeared in the corner of my eye, <br>
It stood afar yet tore down my solitude like an ally.

Colored red, not the color of boiling blood, but more of a fiery blossom, <br>
It was the sunset shining across the flood, beautiful and a bit fearsome. <br>
Its howl pierced through the night and the melody in the air <br>
Mirroring the arrow perforated its chest, only then could I see it clear:

The seeping crimson fluid and the poisonous arrowhead peeking through its heart. <br>
Seeing it left me weeping, while the red painted the snow like a piece of art. <br>
I could not move an inch to help as the gold in me grew heavier. <br>
The angel blew its horn, the Lord left me there alone and bitter.
