I was born fluent in an accent never spoken. <br>
Even as a child I was taught the very etiquette of <br>
How to stay out of the frame, <br>
How to smile without showing teeth, <br>
How to communicate without words, <br>
How to avoid intimacy of eyes, <br>
How to embrace without any arm, <br>
How to be bereft of any and every breath.

I learned which walls could be touched, <br>
Which scars could be scratched, <br>
Which silences could be left polite, <br>
Which questions could be answered <br>
Which lines could be crossed, <br>
Which places could be trespassed, <br>
Which commanders deserved obedience, <br>
Which Gods heard prayers.

I borrowed accents the way one borrows coats, <br>
Not because I don't have any <br>
But because mine was never cut <br>
For the weather everybody else survived in. <br>
I wore them just enough to feel warmth, <br>
Never enough to be intimate. <br>
I wore them long enough to blend, <br>
Never enough to leave a scent. <br>
I wore them tight enough to cover my skin <br>
Never enough to be mistaken for kin.

I attended to meetings I were never invited. <br>
Pulled chairs to the tables never reserved. <br>
Entered through doors never opened. <br>
Spoke to minds never responded.

They would call me many things. <br>
I could hear their echoes. <br>
None sounded like my name.

I was named only to exist. <br>
Never to be called. <br>
It was etched into my skin <br>
Like a curse rehearsed.

Cities held my shadows longer, <br>
Streets watched my footsteps longer, <br>
Buildings remembered my habits longer, <br>
Than any human I met.

I left no dents in couches, <br>
No scent in clothes, <br>
No stains on cups, <br>
No trails on beaches. <br>
I learned how to live without residue. <br>
How to leave as if I had never arrived. <br>
How to die as if I had never been born.

I learned that belonging is recognition <br>
And recognition is a deity that looks away, <br>
A God, ashamed of its own reflection. <br>
When you meet its eyes <br>
It gazes back like the abyss, <br>
Never with care <br>
Always with wrath.

I have been a fetus in a womb, <br>
Always seen through the echo of ultrasound. <br>
Never uncensored <br>
Always blurry and noisy.

I have been advised to be <br>
Useful, <br>
Kind, <br>
Quiet, <br>
Caring, <br>
But never myself.

Eventually, I othered myself. <br>
The bird meant to chirp in my chest <br>
Discarded its voice nine lives ago. <br>
The snake meant to rattle its tail in my head <br>
Never woken up from its hibernation.

I tried devotion, <br>
I tried irony, <br>
I tried art, <br>
I tried literacy. <br>
All to avoid the sound of my own breathing.

I was always an afterthought, <br>
Smoke of a cigarette, <br>
Crumbs on a table, <br>
Smell after rain.

Conversations waited my silence. <br>
Jokes recoiled from my laughter. <br>
Skins were wounded by my touch. <br>
Souls felt stained with my existence.

I learned that my presence <br>
Relied solely on my absence.

I learned that there is no casket for my body. <br>
No water to rinse my sins away. <br>
No prayer to relieve my pain. <br>
No dirt that would take me in.

I imagine being expected <br>
Never welcomed.

Perhaps that belonging <br>
Has never belonged to me. <br>
Perhaps I refused it first, <br>
And mistook it for rejection.

Perhaps this is all that life is about. <br>
To arrive softly, <br>
As if not to disturb the air. <br>
To leave gently, <br>
As though nothing changed. <br>
To speak in lowered tones, <br>
To listen more than breathe. <br>
To disappear so completely <br>
Even silence forgets my name.
