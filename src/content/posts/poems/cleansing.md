Black scapegoats over the sky <br>
Hit their heads so hard. <br>
I wonder why. <br>
Little droplets hit my head.

And my face all wet. <br>
Almost like the Gods cry <br>
For all the troubles I met. <br>
Whole Earth looks at me wry.

I wash my sins away <br>
Leave my name behind. <br>
One last time I pray <br>
And once again I am redefined.
