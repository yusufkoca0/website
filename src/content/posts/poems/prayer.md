Oh, merciful Goddess, hear my prayer. <br>
Nothing I do possess but my hollow stare. <br>
I am on my knees, adjuring for forgiveness. <br>
Won't you please, acquiesce my offerings?

Untie the tangles of my mind, exceeding over my head. <br>
It is nothing like my kind, poisoned by lead. <br>
Futile thoughts floating, pluming themselves on. <br>
Give them meaning, ground them down.

Lift up my trampled heart, lying on the floor. <br>
It is nothing like an art, tainted by abhor. <br>
Mischievous emotions poured down in a wine glass. <br>
Ferment up the bread, deliver them to the lass.

Rekindle my dimming soul, trembling in ashes. <br>
It is nothing like the Sol, bursted with flames. <br>
Indifferent conscience, stands unmoved. <br>
Let it mobilize, forbid it to be halted.

Oh, merciful Goddess, hear my prayer. <br>
Let my good deeds and sins lose their share. <br>
Dispose my mind, heart and soul away. <br>
Let me rebirth and depart on a newly found pathway.
